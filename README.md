# AutoWire.DI

[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/AutoWire.DI.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoWire.DI/)

**AutoWire.DI** is a powerful, lightweight **dependency injection** (DI) library for **.NET** applications featuring automatic registration
capabilities. This library simplifies the process of injecting dependencies into your classes by automating service registration, allowing
you to focus more on your application logic without the boilerplate associated with manual DI setup.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Service Registration**: Effortlessly register services with minimal configuration using the `[AutoInject]` attribute.
- **Flexible Service Lifetimes**: Support for `Singleton`, `Scoped`, and `Transient` lifetimes.
- **Keyed Service Registration**: Introduced support for `[KeyedAutoInject]` attribute, allowing services to be registered with keys derived
  from the names of their classes. More details on this feature can be found in
  the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/rezaghadimim/AutoWire.DI/wiki).
- **No Manual Configuration**: Forget about manually adding each service to your containerâ€”just decorate your classes.
- **Error-Free Registration**: Built-in exception handling for duplicate and ambiguous registrations, ensuring a smooth DI experience.
- **Support for .NET 8.0 and 9.0**: Fully compatible with the latest versions of .NET.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install `AutoWire.DI` into your project, run the following command in your terminal or package manager console:

```sh
dotnet add package AutoWire.DI
```

### Simple Usage

1. **Define Your Service Class**
   Simply add the `[AutoInject]` attribute to your class, and it will be automatically registered in the DI container. You can also specify
   the service lifetime and service type.
   ```csharp
   using AutoWire.DI.Attributes;

   [AutoInject("myServiceKey", ServiceLifetime.Singleton)]
   public class MyService
   {
       public void DoSomething()
       {
           // Service implementation details
           Console.WriteLine("MyService is doing something!");
       }
   }
   ```
    - **No Parameters? No Problem!**
      If no parameters are specified in the `[AutoInject]` attribute, the service is registered based on its implemented interface or class
      type.
   ```csharp
   [AutoInject]
   public class AnotherService
   {
       public void Execute()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("AnotherService is executing!");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Using Keyed AutoInject**
   You can also use the `[KeyedAutoInject]` attribute to register a service with a key derived from the class name.
   ```csharp
   using AutoWire.DI.Attributes;

   [KeyedAutoInject]
   public class KeyedService
   {
       public void PerformAction()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("KeyedService is performing an action!");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Register Services in Your DI Container**
   In your `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` if you're using .NET 6+), call the `RegisterAutoInjectableServices` method to automatically scan
   and register all services decorated with `[AutoInject]` and `[KeyedAutoInject]`.
   ```csharp
   using AutoWire.DI.Extensions;
   using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.RegisterAutoInjectableServices();
   }
   ```

4. **Using the Services**
   Once registered, you can resolve your services through dependency injection:
   ```csharp
   public class MyController
   {
       private readonly MyService _myService;
       private readonly KeyedService _keyedService;

       public MyController(MyService myService, KeyedService keyedService)
       {
           _myService = myService;
           _keyedService = keyedService;
       }

       public void ExecuteServices()
       {
           _myService.DoSomething();
           _keyedService.PerformAction();
       }
   }
   ```

### Exception Handling

- **AmbiguousServiceTypeException**: This exception is thrown when a class implements multiple interfaces but doesn't specify which one to
  use. To avoid this, always specify the service type in such cases.
- **DuplicateServiceRegistrationException**: This exception is thrown if a service is being registered with the same service type and key,
  leading to a conflict. Ensure that you don't have conflicting registrations.

## Why Choose AutoWire.DI?

- **Simplify Dependency Injection**: Get rid of repetitive DI configuration and make your code cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Automatic and Flexible**: Works seamlessly with both simple services and more complex configurations.
- **Error-Free Registration**: With built-in checks for duplicate and ambiguous registrations, you avoid the common pitfalls of manual DI
  setup.
